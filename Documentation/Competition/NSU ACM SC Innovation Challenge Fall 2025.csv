10,A Smart System Framework Leveraging Community Enterprise for Fair-Price Discovery and Market Stability,"This project addresses critical market inefficiencies in Bangladesh’s rice sector, including price volatility, middlemen exploitation, and farmer income insecurity. We propose a digital framework centered on community enterprise approach (CEA) to empower farmers. We develop an integrated system model featuring two core components: a Yield Prediction Simulator that models total production of each farmer based on their region and land size, and a Fair Price Estimator. The estimator employs a “Living Income” methodology to calculate a minimum viable price for farmers, ensuring production costs and basic living needs are met, plus a justifiable profit margin. The whole supply and value chain will be kept transparent to ensure a Fair Consumer Price, balancing the welfare of both producers and consumers. By moving beyond the impractical elimination of middlemen to instead increase market competition and transparency, our framework provides cooperatives through community enterprises with enhanced bargaining power.

They find it really hard when it comes to express their thoughts to general population. This communication barrier between hearing-impaired community and general population in our country is very significant. My project “EasyTalk – An Automated Bangla Voice-To-Sign and Text-To-Sign Translation System for Non-Verbal Communication with 2000 Bangla Sign Word Level Dataset” is designed to bridge the gap between the two communities. This system is designed to translate both Bangla text and speech into continuous Bangla Sign Language. It has 2000 words pre-recorded Bangla sign language videos, which is currently the largest Bangla word level sign dataset. The dataset is mapped to sign lexicon of Bangla words. In the system, we have implemented Google Speech Recognition API to convert Bangla Spoken Language into text in real-time with an accuracy of 94.45% for quiet environment and 92.37% for Noisy environment and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for tokenizing texts in the user input sentences. Suffix Stripping algorithm has been used to strip the suffixes (e.g., "" ""গুলো"", ""টি"") from the Bangla words with an 100% accuracy and then mapped to the mapping.csv file. I have implemented MediaPipe Holistic, which overlays skeletal landmarks on the output videos. The accuracy of landmark extraction is 84.2% for hands and 100% for pose.

34,A Simple and Lightweight Inverse AI Technique to Enhance the Performance of Metamaterial Absorbers,"This research explores the use of inverse machine learning technology to accelerate and enhance the design of a metasurface absorber. While CST simulation alone requires days or even months of iterative trials to identify optimal parameters—making the process highly time-consuming and computationally expensive—we address this challenge using an inverse ML approach. In this method, forward and backward models work together sequentially: the forward model learns how structural parameters affect absorption, and the backward model predicts the parameter sets needed for improved performance. We first design and simulate a meta-absorber in CST to collect absorption data across wavelengths. This data is used to train the inverse machine learning model that learns the relationship between structural parameters and absorption performance. The model then predicts new parameter sets that maximize absorbance in longer-wavelength regions. When these predicted parameters are re-tested in CST, the absorber shows significant improvement. The results demonstrate that inverse machine learning can dramatically reduce design time while guiding the development of high-performance meta-absorbers.",3,No,Yes
