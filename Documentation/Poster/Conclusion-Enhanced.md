# Conclusion: Innovation for the Future

AIris demonstrates that complex, multi-modal AI systems can be effectively engineered for real-time assistive applications on consumer hardware. By strictly prioritizing latency and active guidance over passive description, we have created a system that is not just an observer, but an active participant in the user's world. Our novel rule-based guidance algorithm—operating without LLM dependency for real-time performance—represents a breakthrough in assistive technology, achieving sub-2-second response times through intelligent geometric vector calculation and depth estimation. The integration of YOLO26s, MediaPipe, proprietary fall detection, and Web Speech API creates a comprehensive solution that transforms passive scene description into actionable assistance. This implementation sets a new standard, proving that cutting-edge AI can be simultaneously powerful, accessible, and affordable—a blueprint for the future of assistive technology that will continue to evolve as we scale from hundreds to millions of users, moving us closer to a world where technology truly "opens eyes" for the visually impaired.
