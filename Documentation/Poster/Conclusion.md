# Conclusion

AIris demonstrates that complex, multi-modal AI systems can be effectively engineered for real-time assistive applications on consumer hardware. By strictly prioritizing latency and active guidance over passive description, we have created a system that is not just an observer, but an active participant in the user's world. The integration of YOLO26s for real-time object detection, MediaPipe for precise hand tracking, and proprietary algorithms for guidance and fall detection creates a comprehensive solution. The move from cloud-dependent prototypes to local-first execution with low-latency cloud inference (Groq API) ensures privacy, reliability, and sub-2-second response times—non-negotiable factors for accessibility technology. The addition of handsfree voice control, automated guardian alerts, and complete handsfree operation makes AIris fully accessible to blind users. Future iterations will focus on multi-language support, OCR integration, and expanding the "Scene Description" capabilities, moving us closer to a world where technology truly "opens eyes" for the visually impaired.
