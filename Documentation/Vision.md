## 🎨 Color Palette

The AIris interface uses a **dark-first palette** designed for visual comfort, reduced eye strain, and to allow key information and accents to stand out with clarity.

| Purpose | Color | Hex | Notes |
|--------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Primary Accent** | Brand Gold | `#C9AC78` | Used for key actions, highlights, and icons. Evokes quality and elegance. |
| **Background** | Rich Black | `#161616` | The base color for the entire UI. A deep, neutral black. |
| **Surface** | Dark Surface | `#212121` | For cards, panels, and distinct UI areas. Sits atop the background. |
| **Borders** | Subtle Border | `#333333` | Clean, low-contrast lines for separating UI elements. |
| **Primary Text** | Off-White | `#EAEAEA` | Main text color, ensuring high readability without harsh pure white. |
| **Secondary Text**| Muted Gray | `#A0A0A0` | For labels, timestamps, and less critical information. |
| **Action Text** | Charcoal | `#1D1D1D` | High-contrast text used on gold button backgrounds. |

---

## 🧭 Layout & Spacing

- Prioritize **generous white space** (negative space) for an uncluttered and focused layout.
- Use a **strong left-aligned hierarchy** for predictable content flow.
- Employ **generous corner rounding** (`rounded-2xl`, `rounded-3xl`) for a softer, more modern feel.
- Use **subtle borders** instead of shadows to define panels and create a clean, flat aesthetic.

---

## 🖼️ Iconography

- Use **thin-line icons** (`lucide-react`) with a consistent stroke width.
- Icons should be **functional and subtle**, colored with `Brand Gold` or `Muted Gray` to denote importance.
- Common icons: `camera`, `volume-2`, `clock`, `activity`, `zap`, `power`.

## 🎛️ UI Components

| Component | Style |
|----------|-------|
| **Primary Buttons** | Inter, 14px, `font-semibold`, uppercase; `Brand Gold` background with `Charcoal` text. |
| **Secondary Buttons** | Inter, 14px, `font-medium`; transparent background with a `Subtle Border` and `Muted Gray` text, transitioning to `Brand Gold` on hover. |
| **Cards** | `Dark Surface` background, `rounded-2xl`, with a `Subtle Border`. |
| **Headings** | Georgia, `font-semibold` (not bold), `Off-White` color. |
| **Body Text** | Inter, 16px, `line-height: 1.6`, `Off-White` color. |

## 🖋️ Voice & Tone

- **Calm & Confident:** Use instructional, reassuring language.
- **Clear & Concise:** Descriptions should be short, direct, and easy to understand. Avoid excessive jargon.
- **Safety First:** Prioritize the announcement of potential hazards (obstacles, traffic, etc.) in any description.
> - **Narrative Cohesion:** The system should synthesize individual events into a coherent story. Instead of "Man walks. Dog follows. Ball is thrown," it should say, "A man is walking, followed by his dog, as someone throws a ball."
> - **Contextual Memory:** The tone should reflect awareness of past events. For example, it might say, "The red car is *still* parked on your left," leveraging the memory bank.
> - **Adaptive Detail:** The level of detail should be adaptable. A quick glance might yield a simple summary, while a more focused analysis provides a richer, more descriptive narrative.
